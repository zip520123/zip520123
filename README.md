## Hi there 👋
I'm Hsiang-Lin, a Senior iOS Software Engineer and an advocate for Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Functional Programming (FP).

I believe TDD leads to faster development while maintaining product quality. No more nightmares of fixing one issue and breaking something else—it brings peace of mind. ✨

Check out [leetcodeSwift](https://github.com/zip520123/leetcodeSwift) for discussions about solving algorithm problems using the Swift 🐦‍🔥 language with a clean code style.
